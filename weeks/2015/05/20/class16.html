  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This week we have to make a machine, including the end effector, build the passive parts and operate it manually.
 We have to document the group project and our individual contribution.</p>

<p>So It was finally Machine week! It is a group project and it should span two weeks
The groups got assigned a prefabricated packages with motors, paper cut recipies, motor controlling boards and the Gestalt software package. Now it was time to make a machine. We had a good lecture and introduction into what lay ahead. But afterwards I found myself terribly lost, more than usual. 
So, the team is composed by four components: Giacomo Falaschi, David Montenegro, Troy Natchgall and me.</p>

<p>The idea is to make a machine that make wax rings.
Giacomo has created a repository for the files in github: <a href="https://github.com/ifala/m2m_ring">m2m ring</a></p>

<h2 id="ringbot--a-machine-that--make-wax-rings">Ringbot : a machine that  make wax rings</h2>

<p>The project is to build a 4-axis milling machine for jewlery.
CNC Milling machines can be divided into three categories, determined by the number of axes they have (i.e. the number of directions the spindle can move). A basic 3d mill has 3 axes: X, Y, and Z, or in more simple terms: it can move the spindle side to side, back to front, and up and down. Such a machine is suitable for engravings or bas-reliefs – pieces that are cut only from one side. </p>

<p>Intermediate mill has 4 axes: X, Y, Z and rotary A axis. This 4th axis can be used as a lathe (i.e. the spindle can move while the axis is rotating), as an automatic flipper (i.e. cut one side of an object, instruct 4th axis to move 180 degrees, cut the second side), or as an indexed cutter (i.e. cut one segment, rotate by a specified number of degrees, cut second segment, etc.). For example, is possible to produce a ring with a pronged head by cutting from top and bottom and then repositioning the ring vertically to be finished off in a rotary fashion. Majority of traditional jewelry can be created this way.
CNC mill could produce wax models that cast easily and require little to no post-production work because of the high quality of the surface.</p>

<h2 id="my-contribution">My contribution:</h2>
<p>#design a splindle wax rings</p>

<p>My work consists to design a spindle for the wax rings. I used Sketchup  software for the first  version and Rhinoceros for the second version.
My reference for this design is a chuck for watch, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Chuck-ring.jpg" alt="My helpful..screenshot" /></p>

<p>The spindle is composed by two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“spindle”-principal part. This piece is a conical structure <br /></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/spindle persp.png" alt="My helpful..screenshot" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>“plug slightly conical”.It serves to insert it in the spindle so as to create a radial expansion thereof to ensure the locking of the ring on the step in which will be placed.<br /></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>The spindle has been corrected to the extent of 9.75 mm at the base of attack, also to make the clutch integral with the shaft of the machine. It has a clamp in which to insert the bolt.</p>

<p>In the other piece, the plug slightly conical, the diameter intended for coupling with the crankshaft has been reduced by 1,05 mm compared to the previous design, it has gone from 9.75 [mm] 8.55 [mm]. </p>

<p><img src="/images/prove mandrino.jpeg" alt="My helpful..screenshot" /></p>

<h2 id="tips-for-improvement">Tips for improvement</h2>

<p>I was prepared a clamp that will be mounted on the ends of the spindle, it will prevent that the plug can not slide with the vibrations.</p>

<p>In correspondence of the clamp base, I have introduced a gap perpendicular to the axis of revolution of the solid, this will allow greater flexibility in closure of the clamp itself.</p>

<p>The stop pin has a through hole of the diameter of the bar.</p>

<p>That’s a second version of the splindle, with a different conical plug too. </p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I learn to set up the electronics for the machine and I also designed some mechanical piece, solving some  cinemtique problems.</p>
