  <article class="post-content">
    <h1 id="invention">Invention</h1>

<p>The project consist in these parts: Designs, Hardware and Software</p>

<p>My final project is partly developed using open source code. The design is original and is a part of my research of my final project. All the files will be hosted at my personal account in github at Fab Academy wonderful days ends. All the manufacturing procees can be done locally.</p>

<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h1>

<p>The project will have an Open Source Hardware and Software licensed under MIT license.</p>

<p>I choose this type of license because it permits people to share knowledge and data in easy and clear way and let people to continue devoloping this installation to many propouses.</p>

<p>The key points of the MIT license are:</p>

<pre><code>1.The project is delivered "as is" with no warranty or responsibility whatsoever;
2.Do whatever you want with the code;
3.Remember, give attribution.
</code></pre>

<p>Then I choose a Creative Commons license for the Design.</p>

<p>Creative Commons licenses provide an easy way to manage the copyright terms that attach automatically to all creative material under copyright. These licenses allow that material to be shared and reused under terms that are flexible and legally sound. Creative Commons offers a core suite of six copyright licenses.
All these licenses require that users provide attribution (BY) to the creator when the material is used and shared. Some licensors choose the BY license, which requires attribution to the creator as the only condition to reuse of the material. The other five licenses combine BY with one or more of three additional license elements: NonCommercial (NC), which prohibits commercial use of the material; NoDerivatives (ND), which prohibits the sharing of adaptations of the material; and ShareAlike (SA), which requires adaptations of the material be released under the same license.</p>

<p>CC licenses may be applied to any type of work, including educational resources, music, photographs, databases, government and public sector information, and many other types of material. The only categories of works for which CC does not recommend its licenses are computer software and hardware.</p>

<pre><code>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License

<h1 id="income-and-dissemination">Income and dissemination</h1>
<p>I plan to disseminate and present the project at the following upcoming events:</p>

<p>-FAB11 Conference<br />
-wearable Camp<br />
-Rome Maker Faire<br />
-Fashion electronics Conference-Events<br /></p>

<p>I was thinking a dissemination plan for my project as covered the following points:</p>

<pre><code>identification of a target audience for the project 
</code></pre>

<p>Esole could be useful to  a large target of audience: older people, teenagers, ladies loving fashion electronics, geek girls, etc.. But I think that the combo insole plus shoe plus electronic module looks like japanese style, so asiatican people could be favorite users.</p>

<pre><code>brand creation 
</code></pre>

<p>The logo concept is already defined, I believe to have followed some golden rules in its creation:</p>

<p>-short easy to remember name (E-sole)<br />
-friendly graphics, two colors, easy to identify<br />
-long techy acronomous for appealing users (Electronic Sole)<br /></p>

<pre><code>define an "exploitation" plan, as business model definition, licensing, and extensive evaluation of fashion market opportunities
</code></pre>

<p>So first of all I would try to create the possibility for myself to work ahead with the project. To do that I’d search support through crowdfunding, I’d search someone interested in my idea and who could invests on it.I think that for this porpouse equity crowdfunding sistem like Goteo is the good choise. </p>
