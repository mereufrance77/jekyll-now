This week, we were to draw, render, animate, simulate the possible final project. 
For my work I used three of the  2-D, 3-D softwares in the list.

I prefered to use Sketchup Make to build a  heel's mechanism that's possible to print easily

I tried Antimony to design the heel. It's good for parametric heel, it's possible to change the height and modify  his form.

There are some variations of the heel's form:
I used a "twist", modifier with three sizes: 90Â° -60-25 degrees,
