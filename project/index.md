#Description:
INTELLIGENT DESIGN HEELS is a women's shoes that react to wellness parameters of the feet, like pressure, to change the height of the heels.
Also it reacts to a temperature to modify a cover skin.
The  contemporary reality is changing fast and probably we doing different things at the same times  is more difficult that changing planes in the same day.
I.D. heels is for a dynamic and contemporary women,who adapts to all situations of the day and is able to bind the comfort of the shoe to the fashionable technology.
The questions are:
Is possible linking  the comfort of the feet  with the good design of the shoes?
What can you change on these shoes?
You can change  heels in base your pressure
You can change the skin of your shoes in base your temperature
You can use accessories of the shoes  as necklace or bracelet

#References:
There are reference models on the market of design , launched by fashion houses quite famous, like Dior and other types that use 3D printing for individual pieces or the whole shoe

###How is possible to modify the shoes?

There are twoo changes that you can do:<br />
1. modify the heel, on the basis of 'analysis of foot pressure, or a baropodometric analysis;
changing the color of your skin texture based on temperature;<br />
2. change the cover skin in two ways; One way is to use a fabric printed with thermochromic ink, wich then reacts to the temperature change of foot and change the deign of texture.Another way is re-using plastic decoration on the top,like  3d printing accessorizes that you can attach on the top. 

The resolution of the project has been thought and developed in the following phases:<br />
1.	Research materials  and study the mechanimis to move the heel.<br />
2.	Scan the foot and prepare a 3d modelling.<br />
3.	Design of the mechanism that allows to move the heels. <br />
4.	Prepare the pieces that will conform the mechanism of the project<br />
5.	Prepare all the necessary programming for the project: sensor and engine rotate limitation.<br />
6.	Finish building all the electronics and necessary parts to accomplish the Final Project.



### Development log
The fisrt step  is developing the idea by sketching  on paper, naturally
I attached some sketches here:

I must to resolve the problem of the mechanical movement of the heel:

# Technical considerations

The I.D HEELS won’t host any intelligence on itself. It will only provide the means to acquire inputs and provide outputs.
It will do so using a custom micro-controller board, also contained into the wearable element. This decision was taken to maintain the design simpler, and more importantly reusable independently from the availability of new technologies on the interaction side.


# Technical specifications

The Intelligent Heel will contain the following electronic components:
	•	custom micro-controller board (ATtiny45)
	•	pressure sensor
	•	temperature sensor
	•	power supply
	•	wifii module
	•	conductive fabrics
	•	RGB leds
